# Underdogs
I was reading a book, **The Numbers Game**, when I encountered this assertion:

> Unlike handball, which the favourite team will win the match in about 70% of the cases, this percentage is just slightly higher than 50% in football.

So it was a hypothesis in my mind:

* *'Are underdogs underestimated in the beautiful game?'*

* *'Can anyone use some statistics to make profit by gambling on underdogs?'*

* *Are betting markets too efficient or there is a mistake in setting odds of which we could make some benefits by trusting our weaker friends, **The Underdogs?***

In this repo, I'm trying to answer questions above by explanatory data analysis on a dataset gathered manually from prematch betting odds on **1XBET**, an online gambling company which offers a vast ammount of betting options on major football matches. Events participated in the study are the complete EURO 2024 and COPA AMERICA 2024 matches held in 2024 summer. The dataset is being updated everyday and so the figures and analysis. By the end of the mentioned competitions, the final analysis and conclusion will be updated on the Jupyter Notebook file.

So stay tuned and follow the analysis of **The Underdogs** in my Jupyter Notebook!
